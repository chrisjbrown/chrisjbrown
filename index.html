            <h3>Homerun | Oct 2018  - December 2020.</h3>
            <p>Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Homerun is a tech start up that builds recruitment software for companies that care about brand, culture, and fit.</p>
            <p>I worked at Homerun with a small team of skilled developers. Because we were such a small team responsibilities were spread quite far and everyone was expected to own the entire process of our application.</p>
            <p>It is important to me to defend the quality of the code base and ensure that working practices are up to the expected standard. Ideally I work to find consensus in solving issues but am also comfortable defending my ideas.</p>
            <p>With a small team I found it vital to identify the work that would be most impactful and work with my team to set these on the roadmap.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology |</strong> Vue, ES6, PHP, Laravel, Docker, AWS.</p>
