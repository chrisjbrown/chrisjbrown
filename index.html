        <h3>Senior Frontend Engineer.</h3>
        <h4>ITHAKA | Jan 2021 - Present.</h4>
        <p>Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
        <p>ITHAKA, a not-for-profit organization helping the academic community use digital technologies to preserve the scholarly record and to advance research and teaching in sustainable ways.</p>
        <p>At ITHAKA, some of my responsibilities were orchestrating the migration of deployment pipelines from Jenkins to Gitlab, facilitating the transition from monolithic Python applications to independent services, and implementing efficient strategies such as module federation to independently deploy and serve JS, CSS, and HTML.</p>
        <p>Through module federation each team was free to choose their own libraries and frameworks allowing me to work with tools I was most comfortable with; Vue, React, TypeScript, Xstate, Python, NodeJS to name a few.</p>
        <p>I also played a role in advancing their open source component library Pharos, through contributions and collaborative efforts.</p>
        <p>Leveraging these languages and tools, I strived to build accessible responsive components and fast serverside API's all to deliver a complex but understandable experience to users.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology |</strong> Vue, ES6, TypeScript, Lit, WebComponents, Xstate, Selenium, PlayWright, Python, Django, Docker, AWS.</p>

        <p>Homerun is a tech start up that builds recruitment software for companies that care about brand, culture, and fit.</p>
        <p>I worked at Homerun with a small team of skilled developers. Because we were such a small team responsibilities were spread quite far and everyone was expected to own the entire process of our application.</p>
        <p>It is important to me to defend the quality of the code base and ensure that working practices are up to the expected standard. Ideally I work to find consensus in solving issues but am also comfortable defending my ideas.</p>
        <p>With a small team I found it vital to identify the work that would be most impactful and work with my team to set these on the roadmap.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology |</strong> Vue, ES6, PHP, Laravel, Docker, AWS.</p>
